## Description

Movienite uses the IMDb and IMDb Alternative APIs to search through two databases of film details. The front end interface is built using React with standard top-down state management. The back end consists of a RESTful API built in Node/Express and a SQL database using PostgreSQL.

Due to expiration of our RapidAPI paid account for the IMDb API (not the IMDb Alternative API), trailers can't be searched for. That middleware has been commented out.
